                <h2>Tower of London</h2>
                <p>The infamous Tower of London was built in 1078, with multiple
                  expansions continuing until 1399. While it was originally built as
                  a palace for superior ranking individuals during the medieval period
                  it is most known for its use during the Tudor reign as a place to
                  keep prisoners before their judgement of execution was to be carried
                  out. Today, the property spans approximately 18 acres.</p>
